## Usage example

### Server configuration

#### Prerequisites

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Here is one-click example with [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) router with automatic https certificate generation.

[docker-compose.yml](./example/docker-compose.yml)

Please change domain, path and secrets for your needs and make sure that DNS was propagated for your domain, otherwise ssl certificate generation will be fail.

```bash
docker create network traefik
docker-compose up -d
```

### Client configuration

*Clients available for all modern platforms and should be similar for all of that*

*Here is json configration for shadowsocks-rust client for linux/macos:*
